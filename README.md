# Beautiful-Footers
Free Open Source Footers:
This repository contains a list of mobile-friendly footers that I designed.
I encourage you to upload more footers to this repository.
For each footer, please add a screenshot of the footer in the screenshot foler, update the readme file, then please add a link to direct to a live example (playground) of the footer so that people can test it before using it.

Each footer needs to have a separate folder.
